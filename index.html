                <p>
                    I'm currently a 5th year PhD candidate at Stanford
                    studying cognitive/neural interpretability in
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McClelland_(psychologist)">Jay McClelland's</a>
                    lab. My research tends to be a blend of Cognitive Psychology,
                    Neuroscience, and Computer Science. My most
                    recent research has focused on interpretability and
                    alignment methods, number cognition, and visual processing.
                </p>

                    I use this site to host my CV, list my publications,
                    and share some of my ongoing projects.
                    I list a number of projects on this site that
                    are promising/interesting but probably won't be published.
                    These projects may find themselves here because they're
                    at a reasonable state, but I can't find the time to
                    pursue them further, or someone else beat me to the punch.

                    <strong><em>Abstract:</em></strong> 
                    A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to
                    causally manipulate model representations via targeted
                    interventions in order to understand what those
                    representations encode. Here we ask whether such
                    interventions create out-of-distribution (divergent)
                    representations, and whether this raises concerns about
                    how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target
                    model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate
                    theoretically and empirically that common causal
                    intervention techniques often do shift internal
                    representations away from the natural distribution of
                    the target model. Then, we provide a theoretical analysis
                    of two cases of such divergences: "harmless" divergences
                    that occur in the behavioral null-space of the layer(s) of
                    interest, and "pernicious" divergences that activate
                    hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral
                    changes. Finally, in an effort to mitigate the
                    pernicious cases, we apply and modify the Counterfactual
                    Latent (CL) loss from
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06164"></a>Grant (2025)</a>
                    allowing representations from causal interventions to remain
                    closer to the natural distribution, reducing the likelihood
                    of harmful divergences while preserving the interpretive
                    power of the interventions. Together, these results highlight
                    a path towards more reliable interpretability methods.

                    This manuscript is the continuation of the
                    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06164">Control and Predictivity in Neural Interpretability</a>
                    manuscript accepted to the MechInterp Workshop at NeurIPS 2025.
                    This project helped me a lot in understanding the nuances
                    of causal interventions, and in understanding just how complex
                    neural network functional landscapes can be. A part of me
                    feels pessimistic about the future of neuron-level or
                    subspace-level interpretability, but I'm hopeful for the
                    future of neural network analysis more broadly. And, from
                    a pragmatic perspective, things are as bright as ever for
                    neural networks.

                    <strong><em>Abstract:</em></strong>
                    What types of numeric representations emerge in neural systems, and
                    what would a satisfying answer to this question look like?
                    In this work, we interpret Neural Network (NN) solutions to sequence
                    based number tasks through a variety of methods in an effort to
                    understand how well we can interpret NNs through the lens of interpretable Symbolic
                    Algorithms (SAs)––defined by precise, abstract, mutable variables
                    used to perform computations. We use GRUs, LSTMs, and Transformers trained using
                    Next Token Prediction (NTP) on numeric tasks where the solutions
                    to the tasks vary in length and depend on numeric information only latent in
                    the task structure.
                    We show through multiple causal and theoretical methods that we can interpret
                    NN's raw activity through the lens of simplified SAs when we frame the neural
                    activity in terms of interpretable subspaces rather than individual neurons.
                    Depending on the analysis, however, these interpretations can be graded, existing
                    on a continuum, highlighting the philosophical quandry of what it means to
                    "interpret" neural activity. We use this to motivate the introduction of Alignment
                    Functions: invertible, learnable functions that add flexibility to the
                    existing Distributed Alignment Search (DAS) framework.
                    Through our specific analyses we show the importance of causal interventions
                    for NN interpretability; we show that recurrent models
                    develop graded, symbol-like number variables within their neural activity;
                    we introduce Alignment Functions to frame NN activity in terms of general,
                    invertible functions of interpretable variables; and we show that Transformers must
                    use anti-Markovian solutions---solutions that avoid using cumulative, Markovian
                    hidden states---in the absence of sufficient attention layers. We use our
                    results to encourage NN interpretability at the level of neural subspaces
                    through the lens of SAs.

                    I must admit that I'm proud of this work. It provides a satisfying
                    answer to a question that has motivated a lot of my research:
                    what does it mean to "understand the brain"? We provide the notion of
                    Alignment Functions, which are invertible, learnable functions that
                    establish an explicit relationship between neural activity and
                    interpretable, understandable variables. I don't state this in the
                    paper, but a nice definition of "understanding a concept" is the
                    ability form that new concept in terms of a system of concepts that
                    you already accept to be true. Alignment functions provide a way to
                    learn such a relationship for neural activity.

                    Understanding the circuit mechanisms of the visual code for
                    natural scenes is a central goal of sensory neuroscience. We show
                    that a three-layer network model predicts retinal natural scene
                    responses with an accuracy nearing experimental limits. The
                    model’s internal structure is interpretable, as interneurons
                    recorded separately and not modeled directly are highly
                    correlated with model interneurons. Models fitted only to
                    natural scenes reproduce a diverse set of phenomena related
                    to motion encoding, adaptation, and predictive coding,
                    establishing their ethological relevance to natural visual
                    computation. A new approach decomposes the computations of
                    model ganglion cells into the contributions of model
                    interneurons, allowing automatic generation of new hypotheses
                    for how interneurons with different spatiotemporal responses
                    are combined to generate retinal computations, including
                    predictive phenomena currently lacking an explanation.
                    Our results demonstrate a unified and general approach to
                    study the circuit mechanisms of ethological retinal
                    computations under natural visual scenes.

                    This was a big collaboration over the course of many years.
                    I love this work because it is a beautiful demonstration
                    of how to establish an isomorphism between biological and artificial
                    neural networks, and it shows how you can use that sort
                    of model for interpreting the real biological
                    neural code. I am a co-first author on this work for writing

                    and developing much of the interneuron comparisons.

                    <strong><em>Abstract:</em></strong>
                    When can we say that two neural systems are the same? What nuances do we miss when we fail to causally probe the representations of the systems? In this work, we introduce a method for connecting neural representational similarity to behavior through causal interventions. The method learns transformations that find an aligned subspace in which behavioral information can be interchanged between multiple distributed networks' representations. We first show that the method can be used to transfer the behavior from one frozen Neural Network (NN) to another in a manner similar to model stitching, and we show how the method can differ from correlative similarity measures like Representational Similarity Analysis. Next, we empirically and theoretically show how the method can be equivalent to model stitching when desired, or it can take a form that has a more restrictive focus to shared causal information; in both forms, it reduces the number of required matrices for a comparison of n models to be linear in n. We then present a case study on number-related tasks showing that the method can be used to examine specific subtypes of causal information, and we present another case study showing that the method can reveal toxicity in fine-tuned DeepSeek-r1-Qwen-1.5B models. Lastly, we show how to augment the loss with a counterfactual latent auxiliary objective to improve causal relevance when one of the two networks is causally inaccessible (as is often the case in comparisons with biological networks). We use our results to encourage the use of causal methods in neural similarity analyses and to suggest future explorations of network similarity methodology for model misalignment.

                    multiple neural systems and allows us to get closer to performing
                    a DAS-like method on human brains. I feel the need to clarify that

                    The visual system processes stimuli over a wide range of
                    spatiotemporal scales, with individual neurons receiving
                    input from tens of thousands of neurons whose dynamics
                    range from milliseconds to tens of seconds. This poses a
                    challenge to create models that both accurately capture visual
                    computations and are mechanistically interpretable. Here we
                    present a model of salamander retinal ganglion cell spiking
                    responses recorded with a multielectrode array that captures
                    natural scene responses and slow adaptive dynamics. The model
                    consists of a three-layer convolutional neural network (CNN)
                    modified to include local recurrent synaptic dynamics taken
                    from a linear-nonlinear-kinetic (LNK) model. We presented
                    alternating natural scenes and uniform field white noise
                    stimuli designed to engage slow contrast adaptation. To overcome
                    difficulties fitting slow and fast dynamics together, we
                    first optimized all fast spatiotemporal parameters, then
                    separately optimized recurrent slow synaptic parameters. The
                    resulting full model reproduces a wide range of retinal
                    computations and is mechanistically interpretable, having
                    internal units that correspond to retinal interneurons with
                    biophysically modeled synapses. This model allows us to
                    study the contribution of model units to any retinal computation,
                    and examine how long-term adaptation changes the retinal neural
                    code for natural scenes through selective adaptation of
                    retinal pathways.

                        This project was a good extension of the CNN retinal model

                        the CNN model recurrence and used previous kinetics constants
                        to get the model to exhibit slow adaptation (something
                        that was lacking from the previous work).

                    <strong><em>Abstract:</em></strong> 
                    For the goals of mechanistic interpretability, correlational methods
                    are typically easy to scale and use, and can provide strong predictivity
                    of Neural Network (NN) representations. However, they can lack causal
                    fidelity which can limit their relevance to NN computation and behavior.
                    Alternatively, causal approaches can offer strong behavioral control via
                    targeted interventions, making them superior for understanding
                    computational cause and effect. However, what if causal methods use
                    out-of-distribution representations to produce their effects? Does this
                    raise concerns about the faithfulness of the claims that can be made
                    about the NN's native computations? In this work, we explore this
                    possibility of this representational divergence. We ask to what degree
                    do causally intervened representations diverge from the native
                    distribution, and in what situations is this divergence acceptable?
                    Using Distributed Alignment Search (DAS) as a case study, we first
                    demonstrate the existence of causally intervened representational
                    divergence in interventions that provide strong behavioral control, and
                    we show that stronger behavioral control can correlate with more divergent
                    intervened representations. We then provide a theoretical discussion showing
                    sufficient ways for this divergence to occur in both innocuous and
                    potentially pernicious ways. We then provide a theoretical demonstration
                    that causal interventions typically assume principles of additivity,
                    calling into question the use of nonlinear methods for causal manipulations.
                    Lastly, for cases in which representational divergence is undesirable, we
                    demonstrate how to incorporate a counterfactual latent loss to constrain
                    intervened representations to remain closer to the native distribution.
                    Together, we
                    use our results to suggest that although causal methods are superior for
                    most interpretability goals, a complete account of NN representations
                    balances computational control with neural predictivity, with the optimal
                    weighting depending on the goals of the research.

                    Many neural interpretability methods attempt to decompose Neural
                    Network (NN) activity into vector directions or features along
                    which variability serves to represent some interpretable aspect
                    of how the NN performs its computations. In correlative analyses,
                    these features can be used to classify what inputs and outputs
                    correlate with changes in the feature; in casual analyses, these
                    features can be used to causally influence computation and behavior.
                    In both cases, it is easy to view these features as satisfying as
                    ways to interpret NN activity. What if each feature, however,
                    is an incomplete part of the story? For any given feature, is
                    it necessary for the NN's computations, or is it only sufficient?
                    In this work, we present a method for isolating Functionally
                    Sufficient Projections (FSPs) in NN latent vectors, and we use
                    a synthetic case study on MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs) to find
                    that multiple, mutually orthogonal FSPs can produce the same
                    behavior. We use the results of this work as a cautionary tale
                    about claims of neural necessity.

                    Manifold capacity is a tool for interpreting artificial
                    and biological neural representations. Although the technique has
                    shown utility in many analyses, an open question remains about
                    whether the theory can also be used as a training objective for
                    useful/robust neural representations.
                    Previous work has made progress towards this goal
                    in self-supervised learning settings by making assumptions
                    about the shape of the manifolds. In this work, we use
                    differentiable quadratic programming to maximize manifold
                    capacity directly, without using simplifying assumptions.
                    We show that our technique can match the overall performance of
                    the pre-existing baselines with the ability to tune a hyperparameter
                    to minimize the cumulative gradient steps or the total
                    training samples.
                    Our results show promise for exploring domains less suited to
                    pre-existing simplifying assumptions, and our results add to
                    the mounting evidence of manifold capacity as a powerful
                    tool for characterizing neural representations.

                    We explore the role of language in cognition within the domain of number,
                    revisiting a debate on the role of exact count words in numeric matching
                    tasks. To address these issues, we introduce a virtual environment to simulate
                    exact equivalence tasks like those used to study the numerical abilities
                    of members of the Pirah˜a tribe, who lack exact number words, in previous
                    works. We use recurrent neural networks to model visuospatially grounded
                    counting behavior with and without the influence of exact number words.
                    We find that it is possible for networks to learn to perform exact numeric
                    matching tasks correctly up to non-trivial quantities with and without the
                    use of exact number words. Importantly, however, networks with limited
                    counting experience with and without language capture the approximate behavior
                    exhibited by adult members of the Pirah˜a and young children learning
                    to count in cultures with number words. Our networks also exhibit aspects of
                    human numerical cognition purely through learning to solve the tasks: a flat
                    coefficient of variation and a compressed mental number representation. We
                    explore the causal influences of language and actions, showing that number
                    words decrease the amount of experience needed to learn the numeric matching
                    tasks, and learning the task actions reduces experience needed to learn
                    number words. We use these results as a proof of principle for expanding
                    our understanding of number cognition, and we suggest refinement to our
                    collective understanding of the interactions between language and thought.

                    <strong><em>Abstract:</em></strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
                    remarkable performance on a wide range of
                    language modeling tasks. LLMs have also demonstrated an ability to learn new tasks
                    from clever prompt sequences, without the need for gradient updates. The length of
                    an LLM's context window, however, has quadratic computational complexity, making
                    large context windows prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, a problem with LLMs as
                    models of cognition is their perfect memory for tokens within their context window,
                    and their non-existant memory for things outside of their context window in the absence
                    of weight updates. To address the challenges of large context windows, we introduce a
                    technique that uses pretrained LLMs to create compressed, representations of
                    sub-sequences within the context. We introduce a new token type that can be trained to
                    compress a history of tokens at inference without additional gradient updates after training.
                    These tokens serve to increase the context size while taking a step toward aligning LLMs
                    with human stimulus abstraction. We use this technique to augment the open source Bloom
                    models, and we show that the compressed representations can recover ~80\% of the
                    performance of the LLMs using the full context.

                    amounts of computational resources, and much is still unknown
                    about how architectural choices affect the quality
                    of self-supervised learned representations. There is still a
                    lack of understanding of why compositional features spontaneously
                    arise in previous self-supervised publications. In
                    this work, we propose a class of models that is reminiscent of an
                    ensemble. We show how this class of models can
                    greatly reduce the number of parameters needed for learning
                    robust representations in a self-supervised setting. Additionally,
                    we show that sparsely connected network pathways spontaneously
                    create decomposed representations.

                    In this work, we imposed network pathway grouping on a simple CNN architecture
                    and found that different isolated subpathways would spontaneously learn
                    distinct features of the training data. We also showed that this grouped pathway
                    architecture had performance benefits over vanilla variants when holding
                    parameter counts constant. We also made a poster

                    I think this work was great, but we struggled with our message and audience.
                    It was a project for Stanford's
                    <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/">Computer Vision</a> course
                    so we attempted to frame the project as an architectural
                    contribution, validating the representations on a
                    performance benchmark (CIFAR10 image classification).
                    I think the project is more interesting, however, for
                    its qualtitative findings about learned representations.
                    I still think this work has promise, but I'm not
                    familiar with the greater literature. And since we
                    completed this project, I think there has been
                    some good theory work that could potentially explain
                    our findings in terms of a

                    <strong><em>Abstract:</em></strong> 
                    Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable language modeling
                    and sequence modeling capabilities with capabilities like In-Context Learning
                    (ICL) and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, akin to human working memory and
                    reasoning. Drawing inspiration from dual process theory in human cognition, we
                    propose a novel training technique called Chain of Shortcuts (CoS) that bridges
                    the gap between LLMs’ System 1 (automatic) and System 2 (deliberate) modes.
                    CoS enables LLMs to compress reasoning trajectories, encouraging associations
                    between earlier and later steps in problem-solving, resulting in shorter, more
                    flexible solutions. We demonstrate that CoS-trained language models maintain or
                    outperform baseline models while generating distilled problem solutions, enhancing
                    stability during training, and excelling in high-temperature environments. CoS’s
                    effectiveness increases with the number of transformer layers until saturation. Our
                    work not only contributes to mathematical transformers but also offers insights
                    into human dual process theory, paving the way for more efficient and robust AI
                    systems.

                    Overall, this project's direction no longer seems promising as a longterm focus 😢
                    Another paper called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03241">GPT Can Solve Mathematical Problems Without a Calculator</a>
                    came out in September that essentially does what we were moving towards in terms of a Computer Science contribution.
                    And the cognitive focus of this work is probably too abstract to be much of a contribution.
                    This writeup was intended to be a NeurIPS workshop submission, but due to the reasons mentioned
                    above, combined with a misinterpretation of the workshop deadline (12AM vs 12PM 😅), it was never
                    submitted (and probably never will be).
