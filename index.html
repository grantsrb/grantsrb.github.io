                <h2>About Me and the Blog</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student in Jay McClelland's
                    lab. I study numeric cognition and spatial reasoning
                    using multimodal and embodied neural network models.
                    My interests lie at the intersection of Psychology,
                    Neuroscience, and Artificial Intelligence, generally in
                    the broad, nebulously defined pursuit of understanding
                    intelligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This blog is mainly to showcase my projects that
                    were promising or interesting but not worth publishing.
                    I named this blog, "Project Purgatory" because these
                    projects usually haven't made it to publishable heaven,
                    but they weren't bad enough to be scrapped in project hell.
                    Some of the projects find themselves listed here
                    because I'm currently developing them further, or I
                    couldn't find the time to pursue them further, or
                    someone else beat me to the punch.
                    For each project, I'll link to the repo/writeup
                    and describe what I'm doing to make it better, or
                    why I won't be pursuing it further.
                </p>
