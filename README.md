# Satchel Grant's Project Blog

Welcome to my personal website, hosted via GitHub Pages at [grantsrb.github.io](https://grantsrb.github.io/). This site serves as a hub for my research, projects, and writings at the intersection of cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

## About Me

I'm currently a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University, working in [Jay McClelland's lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_McClelland). My research focuses on mathematical cognition, interpretability, and alignment. I tend to employ and develop interpretability methods in artificial neural networks in order to explore these topics, aiming to bridge insights from psychology, neuroscience, and computer science.

## Website Overview

This website is a platform to showcase:

- **Published Research**: Summaries and links to my peer-reviewed papers and preprints.
- **Projects**: Descriptions of both published and exploratory projects that are in various stages of development.
- **Blog Posts**: Informal writings on topics related to my research interests, including thoughts on recent developments in AI and cognitive science.

Please note that the date listed at the beginning of each entry refers to when the write-up was pushed to GitHub or published, which may differ from the actual date the blog entry was made.
